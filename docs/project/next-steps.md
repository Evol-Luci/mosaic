# Next Steps — Build Handoff

This is the live "you are here" for a worker picking up Mosaic. It points at the
next buildable work and the decisions that constrain it. When the work below is
done, update this file to point at what comes next.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-16

## Where we are

- Docs, architecture, and the licensing/CLA groundwork are in place.
- **[RFC 0001: Core Data Model](../rfcs/0001-core-data-model.md) is Accepted.** The
  four questions that gated the foundation are settled (see the RFC's *Resolved
  decisions*), so the data-model portion of **Phase 0 — Foundation** is unblocked
  and ready to implement.

**ECS core ([#9](https://github.com/Evol-Luci/mosaic/issues/9)) is built and
merged.** The C++ toolchain is stood up (CMake + CMakePresets, C++20, Catch2 via
FetchContent), and the first foundation code is in place:

- `foundation/core/entity_id.hpp` — `EntityID`, the **32 index / 32 generation**
  handle; `EntityID(0)` null; slot **retired** (not recycled) on generation exhaustion.
- `engine/ecs/` — `EntityRegistry` (slot table, free-list recycle, stale-handle
  detection, retirement), sparse-set component storage (`ComponentRegistry` +
  a minimal `ComponentTypeID` shim), and the declaration-only `System` contract.
- `tests/unit/ecs/` — unit tests, all green.

**Serialization ([#10](https://github.com/Evol-Luci/mosaic/issues/10)) is built and
merged.** Reflection-driven, lossless cross-format projection:

- `foundation/serialization/` — `Value` DOM, `AssetID`/`Handle<T>`/`ReferenceResolver`,
  reflection bridge (`to_value`/`from_value`), JSON backend (nlohmann), TOML backend
  (toml++), and error handling via `SerializationError`. `from_json`/`from_toml`
  guard against adversarial deeply-nested input with a configurable
  nesting-depth cap (default 128) that throws `SerializationError` rather than
  overflowing the stack — the non-blocking hardening follow-up from the #10 review. ✓
- `tests/unit/serialization/` — unit tests for every tag: `[value]`, `[reference]`,
  `[reflect]`, `[refenc]`, `[json]`, `[toml]`, `[crossfmt]` — 66 tests, all green.

**Command / event system ([#11](https://github.com/Evol-Luci/mosaic/issues/11)) is
built and merged.** The last Phase 0 foundation primitive:

- `foundation/commands/` — `Command` (the `id, parameters, required_permissions,
  execute(), undo(), serialize()` contract, with a default `serialize()` that
  projects `{ id, parameters, required_permissions }` through the serialization
  `Value` DOM) and `CommandStack`, the undoable transaction log (execute pushes +
  clears redo; undo inverts LIFO; redo re-executes).
- `foundation/events/` — `EventBus`: synchronous subscribers fire in-tick before
  `emit` returns; deferred subscribers are served from a **double-buffered queue**
  drained once per tick, FIFO in global emit order across all event types, never
  mid-tick. A re-emit from inside a drain defers to the next tick.
- `tests/unit/events/` + `tests/unit/commands/` — `[events]`, `[commands]` unit
  tests plus a command/event integration test (`[commands][events]`): a deferred
  event emitted by a command announces on the next drain, and **undo announces
  nothing** — the "enqueue on execute, not undo" acceptance. 80 tests, all green.
  - *Interpretation note for the World layer:* the RFC says a deferred event
    enqueues "on execute, not when undone/redone." `CommandStack::redo()` re-runs
    the command's `execute()`, so a redo **does** re-announce — events live in the
    command body, not the log, and the UI must observe a redo. This resolves the
    RFC's ambiguity in the natural direction (redo == re-execute); flag it if the
    World/UI layer needs redo to be silent.

The three Phase 0 foundation implementation issues (#9, #10, #11) are now complete.

## What to build next

Foundation's data-model spine is in place. The next buildable units are in the
**Engine** layer of the
**[v0.1 vertical slice](roadmap.md#the-v01-vertical-slice--the-first-mountain)**:
World/Scene runtime, the asset registry, the transform system, and the runtime
loop. **None of these are filed as issues yet** — file them (mirroring the
acceptance-criteria style of #9–#11) before picking one up.

Suggested first target: **World/Scene runtime**. It is the container the ECS core
(#9) was built for, it consumes serialization (#10) to load scenes, and it is the
natural owner of the `EntityRegistry` destroy sequencing and the per-tick
`EventBus::drain_deferred()` call from #11 (see the handoff notes below).

## Suggested sequence

```
#9 ECS core ✓ ──┬── #10 Serialization ✓
                └── #11 Command/event system ✓
                        │
                        └── (unfiled) World/Scene runtime ── asset registry
                                                          ── transform system
                                                          ── runtime loop
```

#9, #10, and #11 are done. The engine-layer pieces above are unblocked but not yet
ticketed.

## Ground rules for the worker

- Honor the tier/dependency contract in
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md): `foundation/` knows nothing
  above it; `engine/` depends only on `foundation/`.
- Each issue lists acceptance criteria and expects unit tests under `tests/unit/`.
- Reflection metadata is a soft dependency for #10; #9 shipped a minimal
  `ComponentTypeID` shim (type identity only). Reconcile it when the full
  reflection system lands. Flag it if it becomes a blocker.
- ECS handoff for the future World layer: own the `on_destroy(e)` →
  `EntityRegistry::destroy(e)` sequencing, and add an interleaved multi-entity
  create/add/destroy/recycle integration test — #9's per-unit tests don't cover
  that cross-cutting cycle.
- Event-drain handoff for the World layer: the runtime loop owns the once-per-tick
  `EventBus::drain_deferred()` call at the start of the tick. #11 ships the
  mechanism but not a tick; there is no scheduler in `foundation/` by design.
- If a decision in RFC 0001 turns out to be wrong under implementation, don't
  silently deviate — open an issue proposing an amendment and link the RFC. (See
  the redo/announce interpretation note under *Where we are* — a resolved
  ambiguity, not a deviation, but worth revisiting at the World/UI layer.)

## After these three

With entities, serialization, and commands/events all in place, the Engine-layer
pieces (World/Scene runtime, asset registry, transform system, the runtime loop)
are the on-ramp to **Phase 1 — First World**. File issues for them and reassess
this file as each lands.
