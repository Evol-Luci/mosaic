## Wrap remaining CLI verbs as MCP tools

- ~~**Wrap remaining CLI verbs as MCP tools**~~ — decomposed 2026-09-19
  into one-tool-per-slice sub-projects (this bundled 7-8 separate
  wrappers, too big for one slice): `plugin_list` **SHIPPED** (MCP
  tool 28), `plugin_install`/`plugin_remove` **SHIPPED** (MCP tools
  29-30), `plugin_source_{add,list,remove,pull}` **SHIPPED** (MCP
  tools 31-34). The last item, a `mosaic docs`-regeneration tool, was
  **dropped** (not built) after discovering `mosaic docs` always
  regenerates the Mosaic *engine repo's own* `docs/reference/`
  (`MOSAIC_DOCS_DIR` is baked in at compile time from
  `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`) -- completely independent of whatever project a
  `mosaic mcp <project-dir>` session is serving. Every other MCP tool
  here is meant for an agent building a *game* with Mosaic; this one
  would only ever matter to an agent doing self-hosted Mosaic engine
  development (like this session) -- a scope mismatch with the
  server's actual purpose, confirmed with the user rather than built
  anyway. **With this, the whole arc is closed** (3 of its 4 slices
  shipped, the 4th correctly dropped). *Source:*
  `2026-09-19-project-maintenance-build-project-design.md`

## Asset-usage queries

- ~~**Asset-usage queries**~~ — **SHIPPED**, `entities_referencing`, MCP
  tool 26. "What entities reference asset X", via a third `FieldVisitor`
  subclass (`AssetReferenceCollector`) alongside `AssetRefCollector`
  (`broken_references`) and `ReferencedAssetGatherer` (`orphaned_assets`),
  both in `app/mcp/mcp_tools.cpp`. Classified bounded, not architectural
  — no spec/plan doc, agreed in chat and implemented directly. *Source:*
  `2026-09-16-scene-reasoning-describe-scene-design.md`.

## Confirm `AssetID` referencing via `set_component`

- ~~**Confirm `AssetID` referencing via `set_component`**~~ — **RESOLVED**,
  no longer deferred. Exercised repeatedly and directly during the
  project-health arc's manual verification (`broken_references`,
  `orphaned_assets`, `bulk_set_field` all set `Material.texture` to a
  literal `AssetID` string via `set_component` against a real `mosaic mcp`
  session) — confirmed working, no gap remains.

## Hot-reload imported assets into the live `AssetRegistry` mid-session

- ~~**Hot-reload imported assets into the live `AssetRegistry` mid-session**~~
  — **SHIPPED**. `import_asset` now reruns `load_project_assets()` on
  success, threaded through a new `handle_tool_call` pointer parameter.
  `broken_references`/`orphaned_assets`/`entities_referencing` see a
  same-session import immediately, no restart. *Source:*
  `2026-09-18-automated-testing-tick-design.md`.

## "Tick until condition met" tool

- ~~**"Tick until condition met" tool**~~ — **SHIPPED** as `tick_until`
  (MCP tool 27), reusing `entities_where`'s exact matching primitives.
  *Source:* same

## Bulk refactoring / project health checks

- ~~**Bulk refactoring / project health checks**~~ — **SHIPPED, all 4
  sub-projects complete** (`entities_where`, `broken_references`,
  `orphaned_assets`, `bulk_set_field` — MCP tools 22-25). No longer
  deferred; kept here only as the historical pointer. *Source:*
  `2026-09-19-project-maintenance-build-project-design.md`. Specs:
  `2026-09-19-project-health-{entities-where,broken-references,
  orphaned-assets,bulk-set-field}-design.md`.

## The `FieldVisitor` extension

- ~~The `FieldVisitor` extension~~ — **SHIPPED**, along with both of its
  consumer follow-ups except one. `field_entity`/`field_handle_asset`
  exist (`engine/reflection/field_visitor.hpp`), both read-only, both
  defaulting to the exact prior `field_readonly` output — zero behavior
  change for any existing visitor. `broken_references`/`orphaned_assets`/
  `entities_referencing` cover `Handle<R>` references, closing that
  blind spot. `broken_references` also now detects a non-nil `EntityID`
  field that fails `world.is_valid()` (verified end-to-end against a
  real destroyed entity via `Transform.parent`) — every `"broken"` entry
  now carries a `"kind"` discriminator (`"asset"`/`"entity"`).
  Precise field type labels in component reference docs also **SHIPPED**
  — with this, every follow-up the `FieldVisitor` extension enabled is
  now closed out.

## CI/pre-commit wiring for `mosaic docs` + nav regen

- ~~CI/pre-commit wiring for `mosaic docs` + nav regen~~ — **SHIPPED** as
  a local pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`, opt-in via
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`). Caught real staleness in
  `docs/index.html`'s nav on its first run. **Scope note:** this repo
  has no CI at all (no `.github/workflows/`), so only the pre-commit
  half was built — standing up actual CI is a separate, larger item,
  see below.
